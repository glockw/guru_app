# Guru App

This example serves as a conduit if you were using Apollo 1.X with Redux, and are migrating to Apollo 3.x, however, you have chosen not to manage your entire application state within Apollo (`apollo-link-state`).

In 3.0.0, Apollo serves out-of-the-box support for redux in favor of Apollo's state management. This example aims to be an amalgamation of the [`with-apollo`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-apollo) and [`with-redux`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-redux) examples.
